                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <p>Safety at home should be a priority. Home is where a large chunk of life is spent, safety measures are worth it.
                    </p>
                    <hr>
                    <h2>Security:</h2>
                    <p>Security systems are a worthwhile investment for home safety. By installing basic
                         security features such as cameras, the chances of a home being targeted as a victim of crime are decreased.</p><hr>
                    <h2>Moniters</h2>
                    <p>Monitors should constantly be checked. Smoke detectors and carbon monoxide detectors are a necessity. According to the CDC, “approximately 50,000 
                        people in the U.S visit the emergency department each year due to accidental 
                        CO poisoning.” Carbon monoxide poisoning kills people and it can easily 
                        be detected. By ensuring these systems are working, a home is immediately much safer.</p>

                <h2>Tool Safety:</h2>
                <p>At home, people should be aware of how to properly handle any tools or equipment they are using. According to housegrail.com, around 70 
                    fatalities are caused by lawnmowers each year. That's more than shark deaths and bear deaths. Although the chances somebody will be injured by common household 
                    equipment is low, if somebody is working with tools, the chances are increased. By properly and carefully using tools, a safer environment is created.</p><hr>
                <h2>Child-Proofing:</h2>
                <p>A home with children should be child-proof or if not under attentive supervision when a child is present. Some common examples of child-proofing are 
                    covers on outlets, nets on windows, safety gates and 
                    cordless window coverings. Overall, if there is supervision, 
                    the risk is mostly mitigated but steps can still be taken to 
                    increase safety for the child.</p>
