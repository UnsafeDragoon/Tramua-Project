                    <h2>Summary:</h2>
                    <p>Safety at home should be a priority. Home is where a large chunk of life is spent, safety measures are worth it. Safe Homes can be achieved through technology, family, and community.

                    <h2>Security Cameras:</h2>
                    <p>Security cameras are a worthwhile investment for home safety. By 
                        installing basic security features such as cameras, the chances of 
                        a home being targeted as a victim of crime are decreased. <a href='https://www.adt.com/resources/do-surveillance-cameras-statistically-reduce-crime#:~:text=Security%20cameras%20will%20generally%20deter,reasons%20they%20are%20so%20effective.'>
                            According 
                        to this article,</a> a home with security cameras is 300% safer from 
                        break-ins than a home without a camera. Installing security cameras 
                        is an excellent deterrent that makes criminals think twice about 
                        committing any potential property crime or non-property related crime. 
                        Not only does proper surveillance make a home safer, it can also help 
                        lower homeowner insurance premiums. <a href='https://www.secureitsecurities.com/blog/5-reasons-to-install-home-security-cameras#:~:text=Even%20if%20a%20criminal%20isn,and%20getting%20your%20things%20back.'>
                            According to one source,</a> the home 
                        insurance discounts can range from 5% to 20%. The money saved from 
                        lower home insurance premiums, as well as the lowered crime risk brought 
                        about by a decent home surveillance system makes the relatively small installation cost worth it.</p><hr>
                    <h2>Other Security Measures:</h2>
                    <p>Dogs, man's best friend, are not only lovable companions but also great defenders of homes. 
                        They provide emotional support and physical support for those in need but can also be great 
                        security assets. Dogs can easily scare off intruders, and some breeds if trained properly can 
                        attack any unwanted visitors. A loud bark can work as an alarm system. Just like security 
                        cameras, they work as a deterrent against any potential property crime. <a href='https://scitechdaily.com/study-finds-neighborhoods-with-more-dogs-have-less-crime/#:~:text=In%20a%20new%20study%2C%20researchers,to%20areas%20with%20fewer%20dogs.'>
                            This study shows that 
                        neighborhoods with more dogs have less crime.</a></p>

                <h2>Monitors:</h2>
                    <p>Monitors should constantly be checked. Smoke 
                        detectors and carbon monoxide detectors are a necessity. 
                        <a href='https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/features/copoisoning/index.html'>According to the CDC,</a> “approximately 50,000 people in the 
                        U.S visit the emergency department each year due to accidental 
                        CO poisoning.” Carbon monoxide poisoning kills people and it can 
                        easily be detected. By ensuring these systems are working, a home 
                        is immediately much safer. Smoke detectors are also very important 
                        for maintaining safety within a home. According to <a href='https://www.nfpa.org/News-and-Research/Data-research-and-tools/Detection-and-Signaling/Smoke-Alarms-in-US-Home-Fires'>
                            The National Fire 
                        Protection Association,</a> “The risk of dying in reported home structure 
                        fires is 55 percent lower in homes with working smoke alarms than in 
                        homes with no alarms or none that worked. Smoke detectors and carbon 
                        monoxide detectors are affordable and vital to creating a safe home.</p><hr>
                <h2>Tool Safety:</h2>
                <p>Tool safety is a vital aspect of home safety. Tool Safety encompasses all tools that 
                    somebody would potentially use at home, whether for maintenance, DIY, home-renovations, 
                    etc. <a href='https://www.expresssewer.com/blog/common-diy-accidents#:~:text=Unfortunately%2C%20DIYers%20are%20typically%20not,a%20result%20of%20DIY%20injuries.'>
                        More than 200,000 people a year go to the hospital as a result of DIY injuries.</a> DIY 
                    Projects aren't inherently dangerous, but sometimes certain undertakings at home are better 
                    off delegated to professionals with adequate safety training. <a href='https://www.mydenveraccidentlawfirm.com/news-resources/at-home-at-work-or-on-the-road-where-do-most-accidents-occur/'>
                        53.6% of all injury-involved 
                    accidents occur at home.</a>  Tool Safety at home cannot be understated when talking about overall
                     home safety. Understanding proper safety practices for home tools is necessary for reducing risk of injury at home.</p><hr>
                <h2>Child-Proofing:</h2>
                <p>A home with children should be child-proof or if not under attentive supervision when a 
                    child is present. Some common examples of child-proofing are installing covers on outlets, 
                    nets on windows, safety gates and cordless window coverings. Overall, if there is supervision, 
                    the risk of a child being injured is mostly mitigated but steps can still be taken to increase 
                    safety of the child. <a href='https://www.fixr.com/costs/childproofing#:~:text=The%20national%20average%20childproofing%20cost,protection%2C%20window%20and%20door%20protection.'>
                        According to this article,</a> “The national average childproofing cost is between $500 and $2,500” and $250 on the low-end.</p>
