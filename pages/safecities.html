                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <p>Safe Cities allow people to live safe lives. Safe Cities have many differing definitions, 
                        and it can depend on individual interpretation, but most definitions state the essential 
                        qualities of a safe city as low-crime, a good infrastructure, and a caring and active community.

                    <h2>Traffic Injuries:</h2>
                    <p>Firstly, safety-measures should be taken to stop traffic related injuries. The risk of dying in a car crash is about 2x that of the risk
                         of being a victim of homicide. There are many precautions that can be taken to improve the safety of cities and prevent these car crashes.
                        Fortunately, big cities have some very basic standards of road design that prevent a lot of unnecessary deaths. This article, by “NATLAWREVIEW”, 
                        lists various roadbuilding / traffic control systems that can be employed to drastically increase traffic safety. However, these are mostly a given. 
                        With car crashes so common and deadly, there should always be an initiative to further reduce the deaths. There should always be a constant fight to 
                        further reduce car crash related injuries / fatalities. Cities should use new technology such as data-analysis and constantly re-evaluate their traffic 
                        control systems to keep trying to further create safe roads. A safe city is a city that not only employs the standard traffic control protocol, but seeks to go further 
                        A disproportionate rate of car crashes affects children. By putting a larger emphasis on traffic safety education for the youth and enforcing strict 
                        school traffic laws, this can be mitigated. By ensuring children are taught the proper way to traverse through the city, and by designing these   areas 
                        where lots of children are to be safe, a safer environment will be created. Fatal and injury collisions have been proven to be significantly reduced by 
                        added school safety measures such as a low speed limit. With car crashes overall being such a high cause of death and injury, a much safer environment can be created by preventing them.

                <h2>Public Transport:</h2>
                <p>High quality public transport can reduce traffic deaths and severe injuries by up to 50%. By offering high quality public transport, a city can 
                    reduce the rate of injury and death from car crashes but also build up a strong infrastructure which will create a safer city in non traffic related aspects.</p><hr>
                <h2>Community Outreach</h2>
                <p>Community outreach can greatly increase the safety of a city. Community outreach manifests in many different forms, speeches, events, programs, etc. 
                    Youth outreach is the best way to stop future violence and crime. By giving children good resources, opportunities and role models, 
                    they will be set up for a safer healthier life. When cities take initiatives specifically meant to help the youth, they're investing into the future of a city.
