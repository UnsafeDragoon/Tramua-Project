                    <h2>Summary:</h2>
                    <p>Safe Cities allow people to live safe lives. Safe Cities have many differing definitions, 
                        and it can depend on individual interpretation, but most definitions state the essential 
                        qualities of a safe city as having low-crime, a good infrastructure, and a caring and active 
                        community. There are also some additional factors that while not as decisive, definitely 
                        contribute to a city being perceived as safe. Financial safety, national disaster risk are 
                        also important factors.

                    <h2>Traffic Injuries:</h2>
                    <p>Firstly, safety-measures should be taken to stop traffic related injuries. <a href='https://www.iihs.org/topics/fatality-statistics/detail/state-by-state'>
                        According to this article</a>, 
                        in 2020 alone, 5,766 fatal motor vehicle crashes in the United States in 2020 in which 38,824 deaths 
                        occurred. There are many precautions that can be taken to improve the safety of cities and prevent these car crashes.
                        Fortunately, big cities have some very basic standards of road design that prevent a lot of unnecessary 
                        deaths. <a href='https://www.natlawreview.com/article/improving-roadway-designs-traffic-safety'>There are various roadbuilding and traffic control systems that are employed to increase traffic safety.</a> 
                        However, these are mostly a given. With car crashes so common and deadly, there should always be an initiative 
                        to further reduce the deaths. There should always be a constant fight to further reduce car crash related injuries. 
                        Cities should use new technology such as data-analysis and constantly re-evaluate their traffic control systems to 
                        keep trying to ensure safe roads. A safe city is a city that not only employs the standard traffic control protocol, but seeks to go further.           
                        </p><hr>
                    <h2>School Traffic:</h2>
                    <p>A disproportionate rate of car crashes affects children. By putting a larger emphasis on traffic 
                        safety education for the youth and enforcing strict school traffic laws, this can be mitigated. 
                        By ensuring children are taught the proper way to traverse throughout a city, and by specifically 
                        designing areas where lots of children are to be safe, a safer environment can be created. <a href='https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/abs/10.1139/cjce-2018-0060'>Fatal 
                        and injury collisions have been proven to be significantly reduced by added school safety measures 
                        such as a low speed limit.</a> With car crashes overall being such a high cause of death and injury, a 
                        much safer environment can be created by preventing them.</p>

                <h2>Public Transport:</h2>
                <p><a href='https://www.wri.org/research/traffic-safety-bus-priority-systems'>High quality public transport can reduce traffic deaths and severe injuries by up to 50%.</a> By offering high quality public transport, a city can reduce 
                    the rate of injury and death from car crashes but also build up a strong infrastructure which will create a safer city in non-traffic related aspects.</p><hr>
                <h2>Community Outreach</h2>
                <p>Community outreach can greatly increase the safety of a city. Community 
                    outreach manifests in many different forms, speeches, events, programs, etc. 
                    Specifically, youth outreach is the best way to stop future violence and 
                    crime. By giving children good resources, opportunities and role models, 
                    they will be set up for a safer healthier life. When cities take initiatives 
                    specifically meant to help the youth, they're investing into the future of a city.
