                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <p>Safe schools are fundamental to creating safe cities, safe environments, safe lives. Schools are the 
                        building blocks of communities and the youth as a whole. Safety at school is a necessity.</p><hr>
                    <h2>Drug Awareness</h2>
                    <p>One of the most common issues within schools is the propagation of drugs. According to this article, 
                        by the American Addictions Center, “35% of 12th graders smoked marijuana in the past year”, “30% drank 
                        some alcohol, 14% binge drank, 6% drove after drinking, 17% rode with a driver who had been drinking” 
                        and “In 2016, 3.6% of adolescents aged 12-17 reported misusing opioids over the past year.” This drug 
                        use can severely affect the development of the youth. Addiction can easily begin at a young age, and 
                        with certain drugs, irreversible negative effects can manifest. The chances of death, mental health issues, 
                        physical issues, etc. are all increased through the consumption of illicit drugs in general. It is made 
                        especially worse through the fact that younger individuals may not be fully aware of what they are getting 
                        themselves into by partaking in these drugs, that's why drug awareness is vital for creating a safe healthy 
                        school environment.As a call to action, the youth should be aware of the full spectrum of negative effects of
                         drug use. Schools should put resources into honest and educational programs that promote drug awareness/sobriety. 
                         Individually, young people should seek to stay sober whilst promoting sobriety in their friend groups or communities.

                <h2>School Community:</h2>
                <p>A safe school has to have an overall positive and constructive community. Students should actively seek positive communities/groups 
                    within their school. Whether it's a club, an after school program, a sport, these extracurriculars are beneficial in a multitude of ways. They can give 
                    good role models, teach discipline, responsibility, have students with common interests interact with each other, etc.</p><hr>
                <h2>Awareness At School:</h2>
                <p>Just as anywhere else in the world, putting effort into being aware at school can increase safety.
                     By being mindful, the chances of any harm being done to a person or anybody unknowingly doing harm to themselves are lowered. </p><hr>
                <h2>Don't Take Chances:</h2>
                <p>Students should seek to report any potential dangerous or illegal behaviors to the school or authorities. By doing so, a safer environment will be created. Many students have a 
                    disposition towards this as they do not want to be perceived as “snitches”, however, health and safety should come first. Anonymously taking a step forward could do lots of good.</p>
