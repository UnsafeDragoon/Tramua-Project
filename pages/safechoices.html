                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <p>Making safe choices is very important for day to day life as people may find 
                        themselves in a situation that may be resolved or avoided entirely with the 
                        correct choice. Studies conducted by The Crime and Safety Service Program 
                        shows that the general crime rate found in US elementary and secondary schools 
                        is a whopping 77.2% of that subject area. That's one crime for every 1,000 students. 
                        With the leading crimes being violence and theft. Despite the troubling statistics,
                        by using safe tactics and decision making, these situations can be avoided. When placed 
                        in a conflicting situation, firstly people must identify their 
                        goal and desired outcome. Weigh possible actions and their consequences. Make a logical 
                        decision based on what is know and note the outcome, as it may help  later in life.

                    <h2>Be Aware:</h2>
                    <p>Awareness is the most important principle of safe choices. Awareness can help people live safer lives. 
                        People should be aware of their surroundings, the people around them and any tools they are using. The 
                        less aware/alert people are, the chances that they can be injured/killed are increased.

                        As simple as it sounds, putting in an effort to heighten awareness can make a difference over a long time period.

                <h2>Weigh options:</h2>
                <p>Critically think about each of the risks and benefits for each choice made. 
                    Every choice made has certain risks or downsides and certain benefits coupled with it.
                    In order to ensure the choices made are beneficial, put a lot of thought into 
                    whether it's worth it, an overall positive trade.
                    </p><hr>
                <h2>Research and Question:</h2>
                <p>Gut feeling and intuition can only go so far. People should make an effort 
                    to research or ask questions about any significant choices they are going 
                    to make in their life. With the conveniences brought by the internet, a few 
                    hours of research and questioning can improve insight and thus increase the 
                    chances that a high quality choice will be made. This applies to ALL choices.
