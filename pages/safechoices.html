                    <h2>Summary:</h2>
                    <p>Making safe choices is very important for day to day life as people may find themselves 
                        in a situation that could've been resolved or avoided entirely with the correct choice. 
                        <a href='https://www.cdc.gov/injury/wisqars/animated-leading-causes.html#:~:text=Uninte%20ntional%20injuries%20are%20the%20leading,vehicle%20crashes%2C%20and%20unintentional%20falls'>
                            Injuries and violence are the leading causes of death and disabilities for people aged one 
                        to 44 years old.</a>  By using safe tactics and good decision making, the chances of somebody 
                        being victimized or injured unintentionally or intentionally are reduced. When placed in a 
                        conflicting situation, firstly people must identify their goal and desired outcome. Weigh 
                        possible actions and the consequences that come with them. Make a logical decision based on 
                        what is known and note the outcome.

                    <h2>Be Aware:</h2>
                    <p>Awareness is the most important principle of safe choices. Awareness can help people live safer 
                        lives. People should be aware of their surroundings, the people around them, and any tools they are
                         using. The less aware people are, the chances that they can be injured or killed are increased.
                          As simple as it sounds, putting in an effort to heighten awareness can make a difference over a long period of time.

                <h2>Weigh Options:</h2>
                <p>Critically think about each of the risks and benefits for each choice made. 
                    Every choice made has certain risks or downsides and certain benefits coupled with it.
                    In order to ensure the choices made are beneficial, put a lot of thought into 
                    evaluating whether it's worth it, netting an overall positive trade. 
                    Specifically, people should spend some amount of time, proportional 
                    to the magnitude of the decision, to think about the pros and cons. 
                    This applies to small rather insignificant decisions as well as large. 
                    Taking some time to sit down, relax, and truly deeply think about the 
                    consequences and benefits of a decision will ensure that the decision 
                    made was quality and fully understood.
                    </p><hr>
                <h2>Research and Question:</h2>
                <p>Gut feeling and intuition can only go so far. People should make an effort 
                    to research or ask questions about any significant choices they are going to
                     make in their life. With the conveniences brought by the internet, a few hours 
                     of research and questioning can improve insight and thus increase the chances 
                     that a high quality choice will be made.
